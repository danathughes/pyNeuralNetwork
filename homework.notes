Part 1
LR model with sigmoid logistic unit
Training schedule - batch training - reduce learining rate when training cost difference < 0.0025
150 iterations, learnining rate 0.9 

reduce learning rate to 0.5 - 

Saved output to logger.output after 150 iterations
Saved model - write M N
Write M lines with N entries for weights

* 16-Feb-2015

* * Make Logger class which we can subclass from--perhaps have the model, training and test data as class attributes, so that nothing needs to be passed when the log methods are called.  Or would a Listener pattern be better?  

* * Have a function (functions?) to create confusion matrices

* * Look into statistical tests like ROC, AUC, F-score, etc.  These may be good to put into a logger class, or have as external functions called by individual logger classes.

* * matplotlib outupt?
